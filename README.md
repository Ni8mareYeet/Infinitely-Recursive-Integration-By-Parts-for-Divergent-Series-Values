# Infinitely-Recursive-Integration-By-Parts-for-Divergent-Series-Values
Using Integration by parts recursively, values of diverging series such as 1-1+1-1+1-1+... can be found and apart from that regularized values for other series can be found aswell which cannot be expressed by zeta function alone.
